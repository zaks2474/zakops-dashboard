/**
 * Fully client-side hook for filtering navigation items based on RBAC
 *
 * This hook uses Clerk's client-side hooks to check permissions, roles, and organization
 * without any server calls. This is perfect for navigation visibility (UX only).
 *
 * Performance:
 * - All checks are synchronous (no server calls)
 * - Instant filtering
 * - No loading states
 * - No UI flashing
 *
 * Note: For actual security (API routes, server actions), always use server-side checks.
 * This is only for UI visibility.
